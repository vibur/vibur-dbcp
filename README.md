Vibur DBCP is concurrent, fast, and fully-featured JDBC connection pool, which provides advanced performance 
monitoring capabilities, including slow SQL queries detection and logging, a non-starvation guarantee for 
application threads, statement caching, and Hibernate integration (since 2018), among other features. 
Vibur DBCP has been around for more than 10 years now.

The project [home page](http://www.vibur.org/) contains a detailed description of all Vibur features and
configuration options, various configuration examples with Spring Boot, Hibernate and Spring Framework, and more.

Vibur DBCP is built on top of [Vibur Object Pool](https://github.com/vibur/vibur-object-pool) - a general-purpose 
concurrent Java object pool.
