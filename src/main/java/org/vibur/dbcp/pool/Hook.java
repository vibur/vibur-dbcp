/**
 * An interface that holds all application programming hook interfaces for JDBC Connection tune-up, method
 * invocation interception, and more.
 * 
 * <p>These application hooks are invoked when particular JDBC events occur and serve as extension points of the inner
 * workings of the connection pool. Some of them have access to the <b>raw (original)</b> JDBC Connection object, not
 * the proxied such. In order to avoid interference with the way the connection pool manages its underlying connections,
 * the application <b>must not</b> keep or store in one or another form a reference to the {@code rawConnection} object.
 *
 * <p>Multiple hooks of one and the same type can be registered, and they will be executed in the order in which they
 * were registered; i.e., if there are N registered hooks from a particular type, the first registered hook will
 * be executed first, then the second, the third, and so on.
 *
 * <p>If a hook throws an SQLException it will affect the current JDBC flow and will be rethrown as part of it.
 * Such exception will also prevent the execution of any subsequent hooks of the same type.
